# Hand-drawn physics question, to Box2D simulation on phone

As part of bachelor's projects under SIPL. there was a project to convert Hand-drawn physics (mechanics) questions, into a game engine  (Box2D). in order to simulate the motion of object in the questions. using deep learning and image processing, the model create JSON file that contain all the object in the simulation. and the only thing left is to convert it to the game engine.
This GitHub project contain the Box2D implamentation of this project.

## Little abuild Box2D
* Box2D is a 2D rigid body simulation library that animates physical interactions.
* commonly used in games to make objects move in realistic ways and make the game world more interactive.
* Box2D was written in C++ by Erin Catto and has a JAVA post too, so it can be imported to run on android.
